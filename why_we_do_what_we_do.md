## WHY we do WHAT we do

Everyone has some stories that inspires them to do what they do. We are no different. There are things that inspired us to do what we do today and as the title suggest we would like to share those stories with everyone. But before answering WHY it is important to first explain WHAT we do?

We are a team of tech-savvies whose goal is to redefine the whole process of digital marketing by setting up new standards and breaking the conventional norms in order to provide world class services to our clients. We provide digital services (websites, apps etc.) to the businesses to automate their processes and reach out to a larger audience.

So WHY we do WHAT we do?

If I have to answer it in one sentence then I would say because we LOVE what we do. But let us focus on some other aspects:

1. Quality of existing digital services  
In every field there are critics who points out the faults or error in the methods that we apply in that field. In digital world there are also critics in the form of tools that analyzes a website or an app and give feedbacks.
When we were testing different websites most of the websites irrespective of how beautiful they were scored very low in most of the tests like speed and user-friendliness test.  
You can try one such tool at our website [kilobytetech.com](https://kilobytetech.com) for free and check out your website's performance.

2. Cost Factor (Who may have guessed?)  
In sites like Freelancer, Truelancer etc. where people post their projects to hire freelancers we noticed a trend. Some of the bids were very low and some of them were quite high. We noticed that most of the time the bids were placed only to get the project but not to build a good project which is a wrong way of doing things.

After analyzing everything we came to the conclusion that there is a need to improve the development process of a product.

We believe that proper standards should be followed while developing a product and preference should be given to the customer satisfaction instead of money as a **satisfied customer is the best business strategy of all**. Keeping these beliefs in our minds and hearts we build world class products at reasonable prices that satisfies both our customers and users of the product.
